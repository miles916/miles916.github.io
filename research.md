I am a research scientist at the Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL, where I specialize in glacier surface mass balance, glacier hydrology, glacierized catchment hydrology and meteorology, and big data remote sensing. I have been involved in several projects that aim to understand the state, changes, and consequences of the cryosphere in high mountain ranges, especially in High Mountain Asia, where debris-covered glaciers are common. Debris-covered glaciers are glaciers that have a layer of rock and sediment on their surface, which affects their response to climate change and their contribution to water resources.
